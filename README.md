# NSANTOS-RASP-PI

Today we will be setting up our breadboard to use a sensor, display distance as output, and also blink a particular light depending on distance.

<ins>You will need</ins>  
-1 Raspberry Pi  
-1 Breadboard  
-8 male to female wires  
-1 HC-SR04 Sensor  
-1 470Ohm resistor  
-1 330Ohm resistor  
-2 220Ohm resistor(s)  
-2 LED (preferably two different colors)  

<ins>Stage 1</ins> (Setting up the sensor)

Connect your coponents as displayed by the screenshot below. (Your grounding and GPIO connections do not have to be the exact same as what you see - 
but you will then have to keep this in mind during Stage 3 when we set our code on the Pi) 
  
WARNING: Please ensure you are using the correct resistors, otherwise the sensor will overheat (disconnect the power from the Pi if anything feels unreasonably warm)
